          <h1>About me</h1>
          <p>
            Being born in Transylvania I did not have many creative
            opportunities but I did finish college as a ‘ Text and Image Process
            Operator ‘ and studied ‘Art and Design’ at my local UNI.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked as a Graphic Designer for a good well-known TV studio,
            I have assisted well-known Photographers even worked as a freelancer
            for quite a while, but everywhere I worked or got involved I had to
            enter in this little tiny box. And when I’m being kept in a little
            box, I love to poke holes through which I let my creativity break
            out. This way, I start doing everything the way I would do it best.
